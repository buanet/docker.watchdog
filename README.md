Watchdog for Docker is a Docker image which provides (at the moment) just a simple watchdog to automatically restart unhealthy containers. Some more functions to monitor your containers will follow.

## Getting started

### Running from command line

To let the watchdog watch your running containers and automatically restart them when "unhealthy" status is detectet just run it like this:  

```
docker run \
    -d \
    --name watchdog \
    --restart=always \
    -e WATCHDOG_CONTAINER_LABEL=all \
    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
    buanet/watchdog:latest
```

### Running with docker-compose

You can also run the watchdog by using docker-compose. Here is an example:

```
version: '2'

services:
  watchdog:
    container_name: watchdog
    image: buanet/watchdog:latest
    hostname: watchdog
    restart: always
    environment:
      - WATCHDOG_CONTAINER_LABEL=all
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
```

## Special settings and features

The following will give a short overview.

### Environment variables

To configure the watchdog you can set some environment variables.
You do not have to declare every single variable when setting up your container. Variables you do not set will come up with their default value.

|ENV|Default|Description|
|---|---|---|
|WATCHDOG_CONTAINER_LABEL|watchdog|Defines a label name the watchdog is looking for. If it finds a container with this lable set to "true" it will watch it. To watch all cntainers on the host the watchdog is running on set it to "all"|

## Miscellaneous

### Beta testing

If you want to get the newest features and changes feel free to use/ test the beta version of the Docker image. You can find the readme.md file for beta versions [here](https://github.com/buanet/docker-watchdog/blob/beta/README.md). Please make sure to read the changelog before testing beta versions.

### Roadmap

There are some more watchdog features planned e.g.
* Unhealthy/ Restart notifications by Telegram and/or e-mail

### Support the project

The easiest way to support this project is to leave me some likes/ stars on Github and Docker hub!<br>
